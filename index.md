## Catalog Description

This course will provide graduate students in the social sciences and humanities with foundational
knowledge in data science topics necessary to take a critical view of application of machine learning
in their field and to apply their expertise to the study of the impact of machine learning. Topics will
include basic programming in python, general ideas of data management, a high level overview of
the necessary probability concepts, and a conceptual overview of algorithm design and
implementation.

## Format

This course will be offered in a lab/discussion format.  We will 1-4pm Tuesday-
Friday for 2 weeks.  Each day will involve hands on tutorial, group discussion,
and practice time.  There will be minimal asynchronous work required outside of
class meetings.  

A laptop (not a tablet) will be required in class each day.  


## Related Courses

This course is meant to fill the Prerequisite to
[Machine Learning for Science and Society](https://ml4scisoc.github.io/about.html)
for graduate students in the social sciences and humanities. That course addresses the challenges in applying machine learning to scientific research and in high stakes social contexts. Having students with social science and humanities enrolled will create a more intellecutally stimulating environment, but the learning curve at first could be steep.

This JTerm course will help students get the basics down prior to taking MLSS.

The technical parts of the course will be similar to the content taught in
[CSC310: Programming for Data Science](https://rhodyprog4ds.github.io/BrownFall21/) but this course is eligible for graduate
credit.


## Prerequisite

Prerequisite is a research methods course or equivalent research experience in any
discipline, no prior programming experience or advanced math is required.

This course is **not** designed for computer science students and students
majoring in computer science or adjacent fields will not be granted a permission
